	            <p id="order2">I'm Nelli Szabo, Front-End Developer and Designer. I was born in Budapest, so by birth I'm Hungarian, but I lived a long time in Paris/France, Seoul/South Korea and different places in the USA. Therefore I speak English, Hungarian and French. Currently in the USA. </p>
	            <p id="order3">I've been creating websites since 2018. It started as curiosity and since I printed out my first famous "Hello World", I fell in love. I started my learning process with Andrei Neagoie's course: The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery. It was a very intense course to start because it covers Front-end and Back-end all together from zero. This course helped me figure out what path I wanted to go on as a Developer. From the beginning I loved working with CSS. I'm a creative person, so that did not surprise me. Working with CSS and Sass just fulfills my creative side. After going along with the course I immediately got interested in REACT. It is a great client side framework. After finishing the course I decided to deepen my knowledge in React , so I finished Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) course. This was a great course and the author keeps it updated always. And here I am since I keep building my portfolio with new React sites. It is not just work but a passion for me. 
				Beside React i leart JavaScript(what is a must before learning React) and SCSS. I also finished a "2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" course as a side learning. I was always interested learn this language as it has so much potentials. <br/> Currently I work as a freelancer UI/UX - React Developer for an NFT startup called Valorem Foundation.
